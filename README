The aim in developing this animation was to simulate the
working of the RAINWATER HARVESTING by applying the OpenGL
skills we learnt in class. And in doing so, we understand better the
algorithms and the techniques underlying interactive graphics.

This animation will incorporate features like keyboard interface,
rotation of square, translation of the objects. The Keyboard interface will be
used to show various stages of the animation. The Translation technique is
used to show the flow of water and for rainfall, the rotation technique is
used to show the motor works, and we change the co-ordinates of rectangle
to show the increase and decreasing of level of water.
This animation is extremely user friendly as it requires only keyboard interface.
